## 👣 Just another step...

Hello, while you're reading this i'm problably with my mind in space, maybe thinking how to resolve a code issue, trying to develop random things or just watching silly unboxing videos. The true is: i'm very ecletic. And with the diversified seeds of knowledge that i have, i know how high the branches could reach, the sky! Or even the space. 🌌

Currently i'm studying more of FrontEnd and focusing on it, though i already had my BackEnd baggage (perhaps growing into a FullStack? Only time will tell.) 💻

I hope you stick with me for some time. Here, take a coffee ☕ and let's code!!
